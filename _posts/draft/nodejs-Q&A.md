## Foundation & concepts

### List down the major benefits of using Node.js?

| ***Fast***         | Node.js is built on Google Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript Engine which makes its library very fast in code execution |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ***Asynchronous*** | Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data thus making it asynchronous |
| ***Scalable***     | It is highly scalable because of its event mechanism which helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way |
| ***Open Source***  | Node.js has an extensive open source community which has contributed in producing some excellent modules to add additional capabilities to Node.js applications |
| ***No Buffering*** | Node.js applications simply output the data in chunks and never buffer any data |

### Async - non-bloking

- What is the difference between Asynchronous and Non-blocking?

- What do you understand by Event-driven programming?





- List down the tasks which should be done asynchronously using the event loop?

  -  I/O operations
  - Heavy computation
  - Anything requiring blocking

### other Qs

- global object
- event
- stream
- network
- List some core modules 
  
  - EventEmitter, STream, FS, Net, [async](https://caolan.github.io/async/v3/)
  
  
- any typical problem relate to async?
  
  - in express, try-catch fail to catch async one.



- scope with example



#### Control Flow?

1. Control the order of execution
2. Collect data
3. Limit concurrency
4. Call the next step in the program



#### error-first callback in Node.js?

Error-first callbacks in Node.js are used to pass errors and data. The very first parameter you need to pass to these functions has to be an error object while the other parameters represent the associated data. Thus you can pass the error object for checking if anything is wrong and handle it. In case there is no issue, you can just go ahead and with the subsequent arguments.

```javascript
var myPost = new Post({title: 'edureka'});myPost.save(function(err,myInstance){
  if(err){
  //handle error and return
  }
  //go ahead with myInstance
});
```

#### Big Qs

> Requires big demo, and should be integrated to a big project for trial.

- perfromance - how to test, improve and ensure?

- efficiently debugging?

#### deployment?
